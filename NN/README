# Heston Parameter Neural Network

This directory hosts a clean, modular implementation for estimating Heston model parameters from vanilla option quotes. Every component favors readability, deterministic behaviour, and full `torch.float64` autodiff compatibility so the Carr–Madan FFT pricer sits directly inside the training loop.

## 📂 Project Structure

| File | Description |
| --- | --- |

| `model.py` | 3→64→64→5 MLP producing unconstrained logits, priced via FFT. |
| `train.py` | End-to-end trainer with AdamW, validation logging, optional checkpointing. |
| `tests/test_minimal.py` | Regression checks for φ(0)=1, BS/IV inversion, gradient flow. |

## 🔧 Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- `torch`, `pandas`, `numpy`
- Optional: `pytest` for the smoke tests

Install dependencies with your preferred toolchain, e.g.

```bash
pip install torch pandas numpy pytest
```

## 🚀 Training Workflow

1. **Data**  
   Place a CSV file with headers `S0,K,C_mkt,T` in this folder (e.g. `options_sample_200.csv`).

2. **Run training**

   ```bash
   python train.py \
       --csv options_sample_200.csv \
       --r 0.02 \
       --epochs 50 \
       --lr 1e-3 \
       --alpha 1.5 \
       --nfft 4096 \
       --eta 0.25
   ```

   Per epoch the pipeline:
   - Computes implied vols via the Black–Scholes solver.
   - Builds features `[S0/K, T, σ_BS]` and feeds them into the MLP.
   - Maps outputs to physical Heston params via softplus/tanh transforms.
   - Prices with Carr–Madan FFT (Little Heston Trap) and reports RMSE plus a 5-row validation table.

3. **Optional checkpoint**  
   Append `--save-path heston_net.pt` to persist the trained weights.

## ✅ Tests

Follow this process to launch the regression tests:

1. **Install `pytest`** (only needed once): `pip install pytest`.
2. **Move into this directory**: `cd RepoFinal/NN`.
3. **Run the suite**:
   ```bash
   python -m pytest -q
   ```
4. **Inspect the output**: each test name should show `PASSED`; any failure will report a traceback so you can jump straight to the offending module.

What the tests cover:
- `φ(0) = 1` for the Heston characteristic function.
- Black–Scholes pricing and the implied-vol solver invert each other.
- The NN forward/backward pass yields non-zero gradients (autograd sanity check).

## 📝 Notes

- All calculations use `torch.float64` for stability during FFT-based pricing.
- Simpson weights and log-strike interpolation keep the Carr–Madan implementation accurate yet easy to read.
- No external APIs are required; implied vols are computed locally via the bundled solver.
